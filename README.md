# Insurance_Prediction_Predicitve_Models



# OVERVIEW

This project focuses on predicting insurance premiums using machine learning models based on customer demographics, health conditions, and other relevant factors. By leveraging data-driven insights, the model aims to provide accurate premium estimates, helping insurance companies assess risks and optimize pricing strategies.

# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare multiple machine learning models to determine the most accurate predictor for insurance premiums. The models used in this study include:

Linear Regression – A simple and interpretable model that establishes a relationship between independent features and the premium amount.
Decision Tree Regression – A tree-based model that splits the data into nodes for better understanding of complex patterns.
Random Forest Regression – An ensemble method that enhances predictive accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.
XGBoost Regression – A high-performance gradient boosting technique that improves predictions through iterative learning.
Gradient Boosting Regression – A boosting algorithm that combines weak models to create a strong predictive framework.
Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features such as age, gender, BMI, medical history, smoking status, region.
# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features for training the models.
Model Training: Training each of the five models and optimizing their hyperparameters.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
Model Comparison: Comparing the results of all models to identify the best-performing one for insurance premium prediction.
Expected Outcome
Improved accuracy in predicting insurance premiums.
Identification of key factors influencing premium costs.
Deployment-ready model for real-world insurance applications.
This project has potential applications in insurance underwriting, customer risk profiling, and policy pricing optimization, benefiting both insurers and customers through fair and accurate premium predictions.


# Procedure
